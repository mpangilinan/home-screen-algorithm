Home Screen Intelligent Viewing Algorithm

HSIVA was my Summer 2014 Intern Project in which I wrote an AI program that tracked set-top box viewer history 
and analyzed viewer trends. Depending on such trends, my program would then return which series viewers should
watch the next time they tuned into their televisions depending on the time of day.
